Lately I've been thinking a lot about jotting down all the stuff I learn about,
books and articles read, challenges tackled, simple tricks learned, etc.

I don't harbor delusions about the usefulness of the whole thing, but maybe
it'll actually help me in the learning process. After all, having to explain
something kind of precludes that you must've understood it first and all that.

And besides, whenever's it been a bad idea to share a few thoughts, right?
